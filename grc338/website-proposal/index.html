            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Thrive Records</p>
            
            <p>Thrive Records, first spun in Nashville, Tennessee, is a one-stop shop for all things vinyl. We have access to exclusive records and bring in new inventory every week. We have an amazing team of music enthusiasts who can help you find your perfect soundtrack.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Music does not disciminate and neither do we. Our target audience ranges from young adults who just purchased brand new record players to those who have records older than their kids.  Because of this, our website has to be fully accessible to anybody and everybody. Our target market typically finds our website after browsing our store in Nashville. Our customers love to window shop, both physically and virtually.</p>
           
            <p>Our primary goal is to create an escape for people to get lost browsing our music. Music has the ability to bring back memories, and we hope that shopping at Thrive Records is nostalgic for our customers. We buy, sell, and repurpose records of all kinds.</p>

					<h1>About</h1>
				
					<p>Thrive Records is a one-of-a-kind shop just like the music we offer. Born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, we have created a collection of old, new, and everything in between.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2017 we launched Thrive Records with the hopes of bringing a city of musicians their form of artwork. In 2019 we expanded our shop and moved to Fifth Ave N. We have been buying, selling, and repurposing records for almost three years now and have people like you to thank for that.</p>
                
                    <p>You might be asking yourself, what does it mean to repurpose a record? Records are so easily damaged these days, so we love to transform the audible artform into a tangible art piece. Not only does this allow for beautiful artwork lining our shop, but you can take a little piece of Thrive home with you.</p>
                
                    <p>Music does not disciminate and neither do we. We pride ourselves on providing an environment where everyone is welcome. We hope you can find an escape in music like we have.</p>
