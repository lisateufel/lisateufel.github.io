        <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="Portrait of the owner Lisa drinking coffee.">
        <p>I am Lisa Teufel, latte enthusiast and owner of Harlow Cafe. I've spent over 5 years dreaming, planning, learning, and working in all things coffee and tea with the hope that one day I would have my own shop.</p>
        <p>In February of 2020, we launched Harlow Cafe on 8th Street in Downtown Long Beach. We have 15 wonderful employees and love that you have made Harlow Cafe one of the most sought after coffee shops in Long Beach.</p>     
        <p>My goal has always been to create inviting spaces with great people and amazing products.</p>
        <p>I hope you love it here.</p>
